# Announcer Bot - Typescript version
This is a completely new codebase which is based from my ([Mokiros](http://github.com/Mokiros)) code for a different project.

# How to add a new command
1. Create new `.ts` file in the `src/Commands` directory.
2. Add the command to the `SlashCommands` array in the `src/Commands/index.ts` file.
For reference, use `src/Commands/GetAvatar.ts` as an example.
